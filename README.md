# ArduinoRangeFinders
Running two Maxbotix Rangefinders controlled from a Unity project

Included in the top level of this project are two arduino sketches, this project uses the PW readings as they seemed more accurate and since the Unity project is controlling the pings, we can easily run multiple sensors without worrying about interference.
